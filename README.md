This is a very minimal fullstack app, meant to be used as a starting template.

It has a Svelte/Axios frontend, and a Node/Express backend. No DB. 

<br />

## 1

Open the BACK folder in VS Code. Open a new terminal and run:

    npm install

After installation is complete, run:

    node server.js

Leave server running.

<br />

## 2

As this is a fullstack app, two separate instances of VS Code need to be running. Open

the FRONT folder in a <em>new and separate</em> instance of VS Code. Open a new terminal in this

instance, and run:

    npm install

After installation is complete, run:

    npm run dev

<br />

## 3

A web page should auto-open in your default browser. Click the button to test if

communication between the backend and the frontend is working.
